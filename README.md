This project is an AI-powered automatic medication dispenser designed to improve medication adherence using a combination of image recognition, OCR, and natural language processing. The system is built for patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers to ensure safe and timely medication intake — all while being monitored remotely through a mobile app.

It integrates hardware control (Arduino), YOLO-based pill recognition, and a custom-trained spaCy NLP model to extract dosage and frequency instructions from prescription labels. A PyQt6 desktop interface manages the system on-device, and a mobile app enables remote supervision.

## 🌟 About the Project

This project is a custom-engineered terrarium system designed to actively simulate rainforest conditions through controlled rainfall, water circulation, and humidity regulation. The system replicates natural precipitation cycles by delivering evenly distributed “rain” across the enclosure while a continuous waterfall recirculates water through the substrate, mimicking rainforest runoff and groundwater flow.

I designed and built a dual rain-and-waterfall mechanism using a concealed pump and custom plumbing routed through 3D-printed and woodworked components. The rainfall system maintains consistent moisture for plants and soil, while the waterfall promotes airflow, stabilizes humidity, and supports a self-sustaining microclimate. Illuminated protective housings integrate the mechanical and electrical components into the environment while allowing for safe operation and easy maintenance.

The design required careful control of flow rates, drainage, and splash patterns to prevent oversaturation while preserving the dynamic water movement characteristic of rainforest ecosystems. Through iterative CAD design, prototyping, and testing, I optimized the system to balance biological needs with mechanical efficiency.

This terrarium functions as both a living rainforest micro-ecosystem and an engineering platform, combining environmental science, mechanical design, and fabrication to recreate natural hydrological processes at a small scale. 

**Goal:**

To create a terrarium that incorporates both land and water with a waterfall and rain system in order to better simulate the environment of a rainforest. Additionally, a light system was added to help with the growth of the plants. 



**Core Features:**

 - A combined waterfall and rain system
 - Native and non-native plant species:
 - A paludrium design, with both land and a water feature. \
 - Materials used: 
   -

<!-- FAQ -->
## :grey_question: FAQ

- **Why did you make this project?** 

  + Because I've always wanted to make my own terrarium, and I specifically wanted to make one that simulates a rainforest. 

- **What was your source of inspiration for this project?** 

  + My sources of inspiration are the various raining rainforest terrariums and waterfall terrariums I saw people making online, as well as the Cloud Rainforest in Costa Rica.
