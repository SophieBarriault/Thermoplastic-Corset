This project documents the design and fabrication of a custom corset constructed from thermoplastic and finished to resemble porcelain. Created to pair with my 2025 prom dress, the corset reimagines the original garment for my 2026 prom, transforming it into a sculptural, contemporary piece while preserving its original form.

The project explores material experimentation, wearable structure, and sustainable fashion by repurposing an existing dress rather than creating an entirely new garment. By mimicking the delicate visual qualities of porcelain using a durable, moldable material, the corset balances elegance with engineering, blending couture-inspired design with hands-on fabrication.

This repository serves as a record of the design process, material choices, prototyping, and final construction, highlighting how modern materials can be used to reinterpret fashion through both an artistic and technical lens.
